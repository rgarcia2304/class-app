I have aggregated Reddit results in JSON format about "${searchQuery}". Each item includes a "post" (with properties such as "title" and either "selftext" or "content.text") and a "comment" (with a "text" property).

Before processing, check if "${searchQuery}" explicitly indicates a search for a purchasable physical product. Look for clear product-related language (e.g., 'buy', 'purchase', specific product names, etc.). 

- If "${searchQuery}" clearly indicates a desire for a physical product, analyze the aggregated data and recommend ONE product with the following JSON structure:
{
  "product": "Product Name",
  "reason": "A brief explanation of why this product is recommended",
  "link_used": "an eBay link to the product",
  "link_new": "a link to the company website",
  "isProduct": "yes"
}

- If "${searchQuery}" does not clearly indicate a product (for example, if itâ€™s a question like 'am I short', or a statement or inquiry about personal traits, experiences, services, vacations, etc.), then return the following JSON:
{
  "product": "N/A",
  "reason": "This query does not pertain to a physical product available for purchase.",
  "link_used": "",
  "link_new": "",
  "isProduct": "no"
}

Always verify that the recommended item is indeed a physical product and not a service or non-tangible item.
